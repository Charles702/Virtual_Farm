# Virtual_Farm
To simulate the plant growth, we built a Unity project called Virtual Farm. This project contains a single scene that is built upon a Unity terrain object. The player can control a monitor sphere which is able to fly through the scene and observe the changes of the scene. On the other hand, there are multiple tree spawners that are driven by L-system scripts. Those L-system trees will grow under specific rules in the parameter setting. We also imported a dynamic weather system that can change weather and sun/moon position according to time. The L-system tree growing procedure will also be affected by the current weather in the scene.
